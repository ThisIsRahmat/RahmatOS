Interview Genie first started life as a completely separate project titled Application Buddy. 

Application Buddy was an AI assisted resume writer that I started on in 2022, a few months after I started working on it chatGPT came out and I dropped the project because I saw there was no way I could compete with a free tool that could do exactly what my product was. 

So I abandoned development and didn't really think about it until lat year 2024 when I started playing around with applications for conversational AI.
